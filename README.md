TODO
====

* Change spritesheets
 * One spritesheet per Unit (Idle animation)

* Show a health bar over the unit
 * Change the grid size to 5x5 and make the tile bigger than the unit (allowing a health bar)

* Leveling Unit
 * Need X unit killed to levelup (each enemy level give 1 xp)
 * Each level will affect the stats at the same rate
  * Odd = HP, Even = Atk
 * Stats of Unit should be static (since it's the same)
  * MaxHP, Atk, level, toLevel
 * Need to save:
  * Unit Name
  * Current Level
  * To Level

* Generate decks (for player and enemy)

* Better AI
 * Using a Gambit System similar to FF12, syntax: Target: Action ? Treshold, ex:
  * Ally: heal < 50%
  * Foe: Attack < 10%

* Different Map Tile
 * Some tile should be not walkable
 * Some tile should give bonuses

* Unit around
 * When a unit from the same player is near, some bonus should happen (it: when 2 or more peons are adjacent, they all get a +X to health, where X is 2 * number of peons)

Levelup formula (from Disgaea)
==============================

round( 0.04 * (level ^ 3) + 0.8 * (level ^ 2) + 2 * level)

IDEAS / NTH
===========

* When an unit with a drop abilities (damage every neighboors) is dragged, show the tiles it will affect
* When an unit is dragged, it will show with the enemy health bar which will be the result of the fight (if the enemy will be killed or hurt...)
